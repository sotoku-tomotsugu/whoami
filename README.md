- 👋 Hi, I’m @SotokuTomotsugu
- 👀 I’m interested in software development, infrastructure, and cybersecuirty.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning beginner-level penetration testing on TryHackMe.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... any open-source project I think is cool and that I'm capable of actually contributing to with my current level of programming skill.
- 📫 How to reach me ... you can find me on Discord, Facebook, or LinckedIn.
- 😄 In my next job, I'm looking to work as a system administrator or a junior penetration tester/security analyst.
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I was an undergrad, I did part-time jobs as a kitchen chef at Izakaya restaurants and a room cleaner/inspector and restaurant waiter at hotels!
